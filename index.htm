  <h1> <br>One of the first things to learn when starting Html is that you have to start off everything with<br>< !DOCTYPE html > </h1>
  <h1> <br>You'll need to enclose everything on your html file in < html > and < /html ></h1>
  <h1> <br>Some simple things you'll need to know are like < br >, < h1 >, < head >, < body >, < title >, and finally < p >.</h1>
  <h1> <br> lets start off with < br > this code when you place it in your text will act like the enter key works on word. </h1>
  <h1> <br> < h1 > and < /h1 > codes surround what you want to type for your text. < p > is the same thing, stands for paragraph.</h1>
  <h1> <br> there is more to know. < head > and the code < /head > surround the < title >  and < /title > code. which goes around what you want your title to be. Your title won't be on your page though.</h1>
  <h1> <br> one more really simple code to know is < body > and < /body > because it surroundsall of your h1s-h6s and your ps.</h1>
  <h1> <br> now we'll get into something more complicated. Css, one of the greater things for your website. You make your page colorful and cool here.</h1>
  <h1> <br> when using he Css you need a type selector like your body or your p maybe you want to change your h1's text color. to do that you'd do "h1 { color:_____;}" </h1>
  <h1> <br> when you're going to do Css you'll need to link the Css to the Html doing a < link > code. it looks like<br>< link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" herf="(put the name of the css file)" > </h1>
